# YOLOv8_Object_Analysis
A real-time system for detecting, tracking, counting, and analyzing object movement

Objective
To develop a real-time system for detecting, tracking, counting, and analyzing object movement in surveillance footage using YOLOv8. The system should be capable of region-based counting and estimating object speed, and deployed as a Flask-based web app containerized with Docker.
